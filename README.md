# DS2SOTFSBackup

## Description

DS2SOTFSBackup can backup and restore save files for Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin. This is the source code for this program. It is written in C#.

There were a few programs for the original version of Dark Souls 2, but I was unable to find similar programs for the new version. This program copies the save file and saves it to a backup directory specified for a backup. It restores by copying the save file in the backup directory to the game save location.

## Features

* Easy to use GUI
* Backup and Restore with one button
* Automatically finds game save file location
* Supports a maximum of 10 backups

## Comments

As of right now, this is not a finished product. The backup portion is more or less done, but the program only restores the latest save file. I am still trying to figure out a design for restoring save files that will be user-friendly as well as versatile. There may be bugs that I have not seen yet too. This is the first time I developed a program using Windows Forms and I only used Visual Studio a few time prior to making this so there could be many bugs that arise. I hope to finish this soon with fully functionality.
